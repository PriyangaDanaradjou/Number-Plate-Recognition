# Number-Plate-Recognition
Identify the license place in the image and do an OCR to extract the characters from the detected license plate.

Automated, fast, accurate and robust vehicle plate recognition system has become a necessity for traffic control and law enforcement of traffic regulations. The solution is ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition).

Algorithm for recognition of number plate and to do an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the characters from the detected number plate is proposed and compared with existing method to improve accuracy and efficiency.

• ANPR using OCR is used to recognize the characters from number plate image.

• The below proposed methodology is considered to be the most effective and efficient model to identify and recognise the characters of the extracted number plate.

• The recognized characters are compared with the database for verification of vehicle.

• It helps police authorities and other crime investigation departments to find whether the number plate is authorized or not.
